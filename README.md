Team Leader: Colton 

 

Theme: What theme do we want for this project? 

Our chosen theme: Food Review - ConveyUr Cuisine 

9/21/22 

SD - Researching trouble ticket systems and web interfaces 

CM - Established public branch of simpleui for the team's ability to sync and make changes from anywhere, always able to grab and run the latest version. I will be going over the basics of git and how it integrates into VSCode on the 23rd. This stuff *looks* intimidating, but overall it's a lifesaver.

HS – Created and shared Word Document for Team  

CA – Researching trouble ticket systems and web interfaces 

Created Github accounts for full access of project amongst our team, including contribution metrics that are available and open to the public. Who does what, etc.

We discussed our theme of the project and then determined that the direction we wanted to head in was a sort of food review / feedback system for restaurants (and maybe the gag)

 Things to do  
Boxes - this code can be reused and repurposed from the final build of our tic tac toe project - we can use the squares and gussy them up a bit and make it look good, creating the div for all of them in one easy go. If we really want to get fancy we can take a look at using clip art or simplified icons to pick what food item to leave a review on.

Images and Colors? TBD, after all code functions properly

Site Creation and hooks for the HTML section - again, yoink from previous project and rework if needed. We can do that.

CSS goodness - not too much probably needs to be changed, but a color refresh for accessiblity would be nice. Ideally, we implement padding amongst the elements in the main navigation div to make it more accessible to users working on touch-enabled devices like phones and tablets. This also makes selecting the correct option on a regular desktop or laptop machine a lot less of a problem.

JS work to get everything running properly. - this is the hard part, but we already have headway with our previous material as an example of how to work the very basics of a react web app. We can do this!

Context, expanded: We are creating a system that allows a customer to judge/review their food and leave a ticket to the cooks about what went wrong, what could be improved on, and what they thought about the meal. This system ideally would run on a tablet or similar device running alone at a table and reporting results back to the owners, but this is a web app, which means we can expect it to run on almost anything. With that in mind, I feel like a simple UI with basic building blocks and set options laid out graphically to be the best choice. 

 
Goals, expanded: Create a system that has the customer determine their issue by certain metrics such as temperature, taste, spice, done-ness, appearance, etc. A full list can be created and expanded on at any time, we can use a data structure for it. We should be able to pick an issue on the list and have it highlighted, and have a text box appear down below for comments to be entered. We don't need to handle the long *or* short term storage of the user's input, so design on this will be key. We can also yoink some code from the tic-tac-toe project to get highlighting to apply to our selected object.


Spooky test area for merge conflict rundown. Don't fear!
