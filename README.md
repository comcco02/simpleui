    context - who is your audience? Foodies 

    goals - what are they trying to do? Create a system in which those who eat food can leave a review 

    research - how will you understand and document context and goals 

    patterns - can you use any of the cognitive / behavior patterns discussed in your book 

 

Context, expanded: We are creating a system that allows a customer to judge/review their food and leave a ticket to the cooks about what went wrong, what could be improved on, and what they thought about the meal. 

 

Goals, expanded: Create a system that has the customer determine their issue by certain metrics such as temperature, taste, spice, done-ness, appearance, etc. A full list can be created and expanded on at any time, we can use a data structure for it. 

 

Research, expanded: Let’s take a look at some options for reviews/basic IO systems and base our result off of that, at least at the start.  

 

Patterns, expanded:
