Theme: What theme do we want for this project? 

Our chosen theme: Food Review

SD - Researching trouble ticket systems and web interfaces 

CM - Setup JSFiddle for code sharing: https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=FIriEbP4Mz, ended up ditching

HS – Created and shared Word Document for Team  

CA – Researching trouble ticket systems and web interfaces 

Created Github accounts for full access of project amongst our team, inclduing contribution metrics that are available and open to the public. Who does what, etc.

We discussed our theme of the project and then determined that the direction we wanted to head in was a sort of food review / feedback system for restaurants (and maybe the gag)

Things to do  
Text
Boxes - this code can be reused and repurposed from the final build of our tic tac toe project - we can use the squares and gussy them up a bit and make it look good, creating the div for all of them in one easy go

Images
Site Creation and hooks for the HTML section - again, yoink from previous project and rework if needed. We can do that.
CSS goodness - not too much probably needs to be changed, but a color refresh for accessiblity would be nice.
JS work to get everything running properly. - this is the hard part, but we already have headway with our previous material as an example of how to work the very basics of a react web app. We can do this!

 
Context, expanded: We are creating a system that allows a customer to judge/review their food and leave a ticket to the cooks about what went wrong, what could be improved on, and what they thought about the meal. This system ideally would run on a tablet or similar device running alone at a table and reporting results back to the owners, but this is a web app, which means we can expect it to run on almost anything. With that in mind, I feel like a simple UI with basic building blocks and set options laid out graphically to be the best choice. 

 
Goals, expanded: Create a system that has the customer determine their issue by certain metrics such as temperature, taste, spice, done-ness, appearance, etc. A full list can be created and expanded on at any time, we can use a data structure for it. We should be able to pick an issue on the list and have it highlighted, and have a text box appear down below for comments to be entered. We don't need to handle the long *or* short term storage of the user's input, so design on this will be key. We can also yoink some code from the tic-tac-toe project to get highlighting to apply to our selected object.

 

Research, expanded: Let’s take a look at some options for reviews/basic IO systems and base our result off of that, at least at the start.  

 

Patterns, expanded:
