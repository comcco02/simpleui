VSCode Github extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github 

https://git-scm.com/download/

Once git is installed, restart VSCode.

When you restart VSCode, open a new terminal window and type separately:

git config --global user.email comcco02@wsc.edu (this is an example, use your email you used to sign up for github).

git config --global user.name comcco02 (this is an example, use your github username)

Then, we will create a new folder to clone the repository into, you can put this anywhere.

Note that to run everything you will have to setup an environment to manually copy the main branch into.

Then, type: 

git clone https://github.com/comcco02/simpleui.git
